Minify all of your css and Js Files
________________________________________________________

This code was created to compliment JsMin.php and CSSmin.php by minifying all 
css and js files found in the current folder and sub directories. The class also creates 
a new file having a filename with the following layout <filename before the period/fullstop>.min.js. 
eg if the original file name is style.css the minified file would be called style.min.css.

To run code copy index.php and the class folder into any folder having Js and/or css file then go to 
the browser and load the index.php and you will notice that it generates .min.js & .min.css files.
