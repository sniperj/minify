Minify all of your css and Js Files
________________________________________________________
Firstly I would like to  thank the Author: Tubal Martin - http://tubalmartin.me/ for 
developing the css and js minify classes used in this project.

This code was created to compliment JsMin.php and CSSmin.php by minifying all 
css and js files found in the current folder and sub directories. The class also creates 
a new file having a filename with the following layout <filename before the period/fullstop>.min.js. 
eg if the original file name is style.css the minified file would be called style.min.css.

To run code copy index.php and the class folder into any folder having Js and/or css file then go to 
the browser and load the index.php and you will notice that it generates .min.js & .min.css files.
